            <h2>Quick FAQs</h2>
            <h3>Do you really charge less than other agencies?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Most traditional agencies start around $3,000–$5,000 for what we offer at $1,500 for “The Works” package.
                The goal of Life Hack Agency is to keep things simple, affordable, and honest for small businesses.
            </p>

            <h3>Can you build both websites and apps?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. We focus on business websites and simple web-based apps or tools. On the intake form, just choose whether 
                you want a website, an app, or both, and describe what you want it to do.
            </p>

            <h3>How long does it really take?</h3>
            <p>
                Landing pages usually finish in about 5–7 business days. Full sites take around 10–14 business days. 
                “The Works” package generally finishes in about 2–3 weeks depending on how fast feedback comes in.
